This project implements various AI techniques to solve pacman game. It is part of AI course at UTD.
This is based on famous pacman game The Pacman Projects(http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) by the University of California, Berkeley.

Project1: Search
In this project, your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

Project2: Multiagent
In this project, you will design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, you will implement both minimax and expectimax search and try your hand at evaluation function design.

Project3: Tracking
Pacman spends his life running from ghosts, but things were not always so. Legend has it that many years ago, Pacman's great grandfather Grandpac learned to hunt ghosts for sport. However, he was blinded by his power and could only track ghosts by their banging and clanging.

In this project, you will design Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. You'll advance from locating single, stationary ghosts to hunting packs of multiple moving ghosts with ruthless efficiency.

Project4: Classification
In this project, you will design three classifiers: a perceptron classifier, a large-margin (MIRA) classifier, and a slightly modified perceptron classifier for behavioral cloning. You will test the first two classifiers on a set of scanned handwritten digit images, and the last on sets of recorded pacman games from various agents. Even with simple features, your classifiers will be able to do quite well on these tasks when given enough training data.

Optical character recognition (OCR) is the task of extracting text from image sources. The data set on which you will run your classifiers is a collection of handwritten numerical digits (0-9). This is a very commercially useful technology, similar to the technique used by the US post office to route mail by zip codes. There are systems that can perform with over 99% classification accuracy (see LeNet-5 for an example system in action).

Behavioral cloning is the task of learning to copy a behavior simply by observing examples of that behavior. In this project, you will be using this idea to mimic various pacman agents by using recorded games as training examples. Your agent will then run the classifier at each action in order to try and determine which action would be taken by the observed agent.
